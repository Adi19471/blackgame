                <p><strong>Goal</strong> Beat the dealer by getting a hand as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21. A blackjack occurs when you get one ace and one 10 point card, without having split the deck first.</p>
                <p><strong>Gameplay</strong> The dealer will give 2 cards to themself and 2 cards to you. The dealer's second card will be played face down. You can choose to either hit (receive more cards) or stand (move on to the next hand). You can hit
                    as many times as you choose so long as your deck is under 21.</p>
                <p><strong>Card Values</strong> Queens, Kings, and Jacks are worth 10, pip cards are worth their face value, but Aces can be worth either 11 or 1. In this game, Aces have a default value is 11 unless you go over 21 on your hand.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col s12 m6">
                <p><strong>Splitting Pairs</strong> If you receive 2 cards of the same face value, you may choose to split your pairs and play each hand separately. At this table, you can only split once. After you split, one new card will be dealt to each
                    hand then you can choose to either hit or stand for each hand accordingly.</p>
                <p><strong>Betting</strong> Bets must be placed prior to playing. After receiving your first 2 cards, you can choose to double down (double your original bet). After your next move, you can no longer choose to double down.</p>
                <p><strong>Payout</strong> Payout is 1:1 unless you get a blackjack. For a blackjack, payout is 3:2.</p>
